Metadata is defined as the data of some information

To give an example, it can be, for instance, whenever we take a photo:
- Exact hour
- Camera used
- Orientation
- Dimensions of the photo

There is a difference between raw data and metadata
One complements the other, the first one provides actual attributes of the information
Metadata is a way to transform the data in a way that it can be interpreted and considered to manipulate it

Also, we can find active [describes data, as well as the information that can be provided] and passive [gotten by us] data
